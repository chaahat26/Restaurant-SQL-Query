# Restaurant-SQL-Query
In my data analysis project using a Kaggle restaurant dataset, I've expertly employed various SQL techniques to extract meaningful insights. By skillfully implementing SQL joins, I've seamlessly integrated data from multiple tables, enabling me to uncover hidden relationships between disparate data points. Utilizing window functions partitioned by relevant attributes, I've conducted in-depth calculations and aggregations, providing a broader perspective on the dataset. The NTILE function has been instrumental in segmenting the data into quantiles or percentiles, while DISTINCT has helped filter out duplicate values, ensuring data accuracy. Dense Rank, as a window function, has allowed me to assign unique ranks, handling tied rows efficiently. Leveraging Common Table Expressions (CTEs) has simplified complex queries, improving code readability. This extensive analysis has enabled me to evaluate restaurant ratings, their distribution across price ranges, the prevalence of alcohol service, and seating options by price category, offering valuable insights for data-driven decisions in various domains, including business recommendations, customer preferences, and market analysis.
